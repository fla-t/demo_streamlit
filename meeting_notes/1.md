# Initial call with Ilan

## inputs

- csv: that contains as notes column.
- float: input for sensitivity/threshold of the distance/match between the embeddings

## outputs

- csv: high risk keywords from the other csv, if there is a match just give a category from the other csv

anything else? Nope

## What am I going to do:

1. Take the csv
2. Take out all of the notes from it
3. Make a unique namespace for it
4. upsert
5. search
